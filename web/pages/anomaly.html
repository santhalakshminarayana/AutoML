					<h3>Multivariate Guassian Distribution</h3>

				<p>Guassian Distribution on multiple variables detect anomalies which lies far away from central distribution of any class consider.</p>

					<h3>DBSCAN</h3>
				</a>
				<p> Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is based on this intuitive notion of “clusters” and “noise”. The key idea is that for each point of a cluster, the neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of points.</p>

					<h3>Isolation Forest</h3>
				</a>
				<p> Isolation Forest "isolates" observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature</p>
