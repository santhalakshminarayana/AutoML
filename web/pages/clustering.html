					<h3>K-Means</h3>
				</a>
				<p>K-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.</p>

					<h3>Agglomerative / Hierarchial</h3>
				</a>
				<p> Agglomerative Clustering seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters following 'bottom-up' approach by merging pair of clusters merging as a single cluster and moves up the hierarchy.

					<h3>DBSCAN</h3>
				</a>
				<p> Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is based on this intuitive notion of “clusters” and “noise”. The key idea is that for each point of a cluster, the neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of points.</p>
