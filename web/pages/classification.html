					<h3>Nearest Neighbors</h3>
				</a>
				<p>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) locates the K most similar instances in the training dataset for a new data instance. From the K neighbors, most similar class is taken as output class among closest neigbhors.</p>

					<h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Logistic regression assign observations to a discrete set of classes. Unlike linear regression which outputs continuous number values, logistic regression transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability value which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes.</p>

					<h3>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h3>
				</a>
				<p>An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.</p>

					<h3>Random Forest Classifier</h3>
				</a>
				<p>Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.</p>
